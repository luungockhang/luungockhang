~~Personal GitHub account for school projects. At the moment I am enrolling in second diploma program at a local university.~~
Update - 2025 Feb: I finished my program at the university, I'm now open for job offers.

I am proficient in C/C++, C#, Python and open to opportunities to learn new things.
Sometimes I make scripts to do stuffs on computer without manually clicking them.
