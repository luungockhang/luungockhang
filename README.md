Personal GitHub account for school projects. At the moment I am enrolling in second diploma program at a local university.


I am learning to code in C# and HTML and open to opportunities to learn new things.
Also doing some Python and web stuffs. Sometimes I make scripts to do stuffs on computer without clicking (but typing).
